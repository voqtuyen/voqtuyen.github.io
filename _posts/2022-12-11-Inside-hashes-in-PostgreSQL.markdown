### What is a hash function?
Link: [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
- A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to **fixed-size** values. 
- The values returned by a hash function are called **hash values**, **hash codes**, **digests**, or simply **hashes**. 
- The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a **hash table**. 
- Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called **hashing**

### Uses of Hashes
- Python dictionaries
- Database indexes
### Good Hash Functions
- Deterministic
